# GD50-games

These are extended versions of required game projects for Harvard's CS50â€™s Introduction to Game Development: GD50

The base code for these games was provided from the course instructor Colton Ogden. Big thanks to him!

Current code for all games has more tweaks/features than the course projects requirements.
