# GD50-games

These are extended versions of required game projects for Harvard's CS50â€™s Introduction to Game Development: GD50

The base code for these games was provided from the course instructor Colton Ogden. Big thanks to him!

Current code for all games has more tweaks/features than the course projects requirements.

## Games

1. [Pong](./pong)
2. [Flappy bird](./flappy-bird)
3. [Breakout](./breakout)
4. [Match 3](./Match-3)

### **For any current course students if you take these projects as they are and submit them you will not get full marks as these have different features than the required functionalities**
