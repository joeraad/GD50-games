# Breakout

[Demo Video](https://youtu.be/vA0I8rq11wQ)

Originally developed by Atari in 1976. An effective evolution of
Pong, Breakout ditched the two-player mechanic in favor of a single-
player game where the player, still controlling a paddle, was tasked
with eliminating a screen full of differently placed bricks of varying
values by deflecting a ball back at them.

This version is built to more closely resemble the NES than
the original Pong machines or the Atari 2600 in terms of
resolution, though in widescreen (16:9) so it looks nicer on modern systems.

## Base code was standard breakout gameplay

### Modified version:

- Added Ball multiplication powerup
- Added Tier system for blocks
- Added Locked blocks and key powerup
- Added Health Recovery system
- Added Paddle Shrink/ Grow after a heart has been lost/ gained
