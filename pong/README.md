# Pong

Originally programmed by Atari in 1972. Features two
paddles, controlled by players, with the goal of getting
the ball past your opponent's edge. First to 10 points wins.

This version is built to more closely resemble the NES than
the original Pong machines or the Atari 2600 in terms of
resolution, though in widescreen (16:9) so it looks nicer on modern systems.

## Base code was a two player game.

### Modified version:

- Added AI instead of player 2
